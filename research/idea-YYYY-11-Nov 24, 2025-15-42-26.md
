## 🚀 Why This Matters
This project aims to create a collaborative web platform where AI agents and human users can work together in real-time to build and evolve web applications. It leverages the strengths of both AI (automation, data analysis) and humans (creativity, critical thinking) to accelerate web development, improve user experience, and unlock new possibilities in online interaction. The platform fosters a symbiotic relationship, leading to more innovative and user-centric web solutions.

## 📄 Summary (Human-Readable Style)
Imagine a world where building websites is a team effort between humans and AI! This project is all about creating that world. We're making a platform where developers can team up with AI agents to build awesome web apps faster and smarter. The AI helps with coding, debugging, and even suggesting design improvements, while humans bring the creative vision and critical thinking. It's like having a super-powered coding assistant that never sleeps. We believe this could revolutionize web development, making it more accessible and innovative for everyone. The journey starts with a basic prototype, moving towards a fully-fledged collaborative environment and eventually, scaling to handle a massive user base. Of course, we're keeping a close eye on things like data privacy and AI accuracy along the way.
